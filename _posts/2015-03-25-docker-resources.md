We are approaching the time that our customers are looking to really start leveraging the power of Docker and tackle the rather scary concept of Docker in production.
<br/>
There is quite a lot of information already available and many people tackling this problem. This is a collection of resources that will hopefully help with this process.
<br/>
I'll also build up a list of hurdles that need to be overcome.
