### Elastic IP

Using Amazon's elastic IPs means that when the instance is restarted the IP remaps meaning that you don't have to change configuration.

When an EC2 instance queries the external DNS name of an Elastic IP, the EC2 DNS server returns the internal IP address of the instance to which the Elastic IP address is currently assigned.

{% highlight bash %}

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-13-108 ~]$ host ec2-54-67-44-243.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
ec2-54-67-44-243.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com has address 172.31.15.62

{% endhighlight %}

### SSH Config

Adding the instances to the ssh config means that they can then be referenced in the Ansible inventory and all authentication is handled behind the scenes.

{% highlight bash %}
Host ec2-boapp
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile /home/jmorgan/.ssh/jmorgan_openbet_ca.pem
    ProxyCommand ssh -q rosalind nc -q0 ec2-54-67-42-13.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com 22
{% endhighlight %}
